# Generate Generalized Additive Model predictions of fish

This script takes the tidy datasets created in previous steps, along
with the top models selection using FSSgam, and creates GAM regression
plots. These plots are useful to correctly interpret the relationships
between response and predictor variables, and allow for ecological
investigation of top models.
