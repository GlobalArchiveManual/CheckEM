# Select top models for fish using FSSgam

This script takes the tidy datasets created in the previous steps and
runs model selection. The model selection process utilises the ‘FSSgam’
package created by Becky Fisher, to investigate relationships between
predictors and response variables, and create sensible models. Once an
appropriate model has been chosen by the user, we then provide R script
to spatially predict the response variables and plot these in a tidy
format.
