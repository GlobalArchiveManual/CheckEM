\title{Expand Life-History Data Frame for Species and Regions}
\usage{
expand_life_history(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame containing life history information with a column for marine regions.
The \code{marine_region} column should contain comma-separated region codes (e.g., "NW, N, CS").}
}
\value{
A data frame where each species-region combination is represented in a separate row.
The \code{marine_region} codes are expanded to their full names (e.g., "NW" to "North-west").
}
\description{
This function takes a life-history data frame where multiple marine regions for each species
are listed in a single cell, separated by commas. It expands this data frame so that each
species-region combination gets its own row, with marine regions translated into their full names.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample data frame with species and comma-separated marine regions
dat <- data.frame(
  species = c("Species A", "Species B"),
  marine_region = c("NW, N, CS", "TE, SE")
)

# Expand the data frame to have one row per species-region combination
expanded_dat <- expand_life_history(dat)

# Check the result
print(expanded_dat)

}
