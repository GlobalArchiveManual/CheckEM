\title{Calculate Minimum and Maximum Size Limits for Fish Species}
\usage{
create_min_max(life_history, minimum, maximum)
}
\arguments{
\item{life_history}{A data frame containing fish life history information. This data frame
should include columns for \code{family}, \code{genus}, \code{species}, and \code{length_max_cm} (the maximum length
in centimeters). Missing values in \code{length_max_cm} will be filled using average lengths from
genus or family levels if available.}

\item{minimum}{A numeric value representing the multiplier to calculate the minimum size limit.
The final minimum size limit in millimeters is computed as \code{minimum * length_max_mm}.}

\item{maximum}{A numeric value representing the multiplier to calculate the maximum size limit.
The final maximum size limit in millimeters is computed as \code{maximum * length_max_mm}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{family}: Fish family.
\item \strong{genus}: Fish genus.
\item \strong{species}: Fish species.
\item \strong{min_length_mm}: Calculated minimum size limit in millimeters.
\item \strong{max_length_mm}: Calculated maximum size limit in millimeters.
\item \strong{length_max_mm}: Maximum length of the fish in millimeters.
}
Rows with missing minimum length values are excluded from the result.
}
\description{
This function processes a data frame containing fish life history information to compute
minimum and maximum size limits for each species based on their maximum length to check your annotations against.
It uses the maximum length data from genus and family levels to fill in any missing
maximum lengths at the species level. The resulting data frame includes the computed
minimum and maximum size limits in millimeters.

# Assume australia_life_history is a data frame with appropriate columns
life_history_with_min_max <- create_min_max(australia_life_history, minimum = 15, maximum = 85)
