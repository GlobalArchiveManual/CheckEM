#### A shiny app to check EventMeasure outputs against life history traits, synonyms and fishbase
CheckEM’s aims to provide a web based application to upload database exports from EventMeasure to:

##### *Check metadata:*
- Check samples in the points data that are missing metadata
- Connect to shapefiles of marine regions and marine parks to determine region and status.

##### *Check MaxN:*
- Create MaxN from points text file
- Change synonyms (from curated list)
- Check species that haven’t been observed in the area before (from life history list)
- Plot distribution spatially
- Plot patterns in abundance (by status, location and site).

##### *Check Length and 3D points:*
- Limit range
- Plot patterns in length distribution (by status)
- Compare MaxN to number of individuals measured (Length)

##### *Create biomass:*
- Plot top species by biomass
- With option to exclude elasmobranchs
- Plot individual species (by zone and status)

##### *Download data*
- “clean” data (maxn and length)
