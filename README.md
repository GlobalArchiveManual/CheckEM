# CheckEM
CheckEM is an R package and [shiny app](marine-ecology.shinyapps.io/CheckEM/) for checking, visualizing and analysing stereo-video annotation data.

The idea behind CheckEM is to provide fish and benthic ecologists with a set of tools to quickly and effectively quality control, format and analyse their data collected using stereo-video methods. 

Here we have provided:

* R workflows for fish and benthic annotation data sets using the functions in CheckEM.
* A web based app hosted on shinyapps.io to enable users of stereo-video who aren't familiar with R to quality control and format their annotations
* A [user guide for the CheckEM shiny app](globalarchivemanual.github.io/CheckEM/docs/CheckEM_user_guide.pdf)
* Annotation guides for [EventMeasure](globalarchivemanual.github.io/CheckEM/docs/EventMeasure_annotation_guide.pdf) and [TransectMeasure](globalarchivemanual.github.io/CheckEM/docs/TransectMeasure_annotation_guide.pdf). 

We hope that our efforts to standardise the annotation and QC of stereo-video data will result in data which meet the [FAIR principles](ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/) of interoperability and reusability.

## To install in R
```
install.packages('devtools')
library('devtools')

devtools::install_github("GlobalArchiveManual/CheckEM")
library(CheckEM)
```

## CheckEM is available as a shiny app
CheckEM is available as a web based app hosted on shinyapps.io and can be accessed through [this link](https://marine-ecology.shinyapps.io/CheckEM/)
You can run a local version of CheckEM (without the internet) using R via:

```
CheckEM::runCheckEM()
```
