2.0.0 (released 31/01/2023)
Changed
- Select a directory instead of manually choosing files (finds files named with "_Metadata.csv", "_Points.txt", etc.)
- One button to download all exports
- Exports are now split by campaign to allow easier uploading to GlobalArchive API
- Option to remove columns generated by CheckEM
- Metadata needs to have new "Date.time" column and "Observer.count" + "Observer.length"

Fixed 
- Samples with no fish not dropped in exports with zeros.
