#### CheckEM is a web based application to check annotations from stereo imagery.

#### *Checks sample metadata:*
- Checks if any samples in the abundance data or length data are missing sample metadata.
- Checks if any samples in the sample metadata are missing abundance or length data.
- Overlays shapefiles of marine regions and marine spatial zoning to determine region and no-take status.
 
#### *Creates and checks MaxN:*
- Create MaxN from count data.
- Change synonyms (from a curated list).
- Check species that haven’t been observed in the area before (from a chosen life history list).
- Plot distribution spatially.
- Plot patterns in abundance (by status, location and site).

#### *Checks Length and 3D points:*
- Checks lengths against the known maximum lengths.
- Limits range, RMS and precision.
- Plot patterns in length distribution (by status).

#### *Creates biomass:*
- Plot top species by biomass.
- Plot individual species (by zone and status).

#### *Downloads data*
- Download a list of all potential errors.
- Download “clean” data (count, length and mass).
- Option to add in zeros where species aren't observed.
